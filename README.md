Notes
First Time Visitor:
UX Design Student
As a user, I want to be able to book 1on1 coaching to help me with my job interviews.
We know this to be true, if a user books a 1on1 coaching call.
I think adding a Coaching section with a button to book 1on1 coaching would help the user.
Returning Visitor:
Student
As a user, I want to have access to a Resource section with files to help me with my application.

We know this to be true, if a user downloads a file from the Resource section.
I think adding a link to the  Resources page in the navigation should help the user.
Frequent Visitor
As a user, I want to see Career Tips so that I can see relevant advice for landing a job in UX.
We know this to be true, if a user engages with the Career Tips section.
I think adding a link to the Career Tips page that includes video or blog updates would help the user.
